# T-Bone Mendez Snipes Test Mod

This script mod contains only the mission T-Bone Mendez.

On new game, it will instantly put you at the location near the targets to test/practice the snipes.

Instead of progressing or failing the mission when the requirements to do so are met, the script will simply reset to a state where the player can retry.

The test won't reset if the player enters the area where the cutscene triggers automatically. Instead, if the additional text strings are present, a message will be displayed. This gives the player some feedback on where the trigger area is.

# Installation
Backup the main.scm and script.img files in data/script and place the main.scm and script.img in this repository in the same folder.

The mod contains some additional text strings. If you want those, backup the american.gxt in the text folder and place this repository's american.gxt in its place.
